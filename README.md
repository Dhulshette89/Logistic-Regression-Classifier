# Logistic-Regression-Classifier
Description of Problem -  Implement logistic regression classifier.Calculate accuracy.

• Description of your Solution -
Data is classified and accuracy is measured in every fold. Experimented different learning rates, weight vector and cost function
are impacted with every change. 
One of the suitable learning rate for the given weight vector initilization is 0.15.
The cost function is plotted against the each iteration.

• Assumption : assuming 0.5 is the threshold value and any value >=0.5 is classified as label 1.
Output is as follows:

ans =
 1.00000
 1.00000
 0.90000
 1.00000
 1.00000
 1.00000
 1.00000
 0.90000
 0.90000
 0.90000
	
 Average Accuarcy=0.960000
